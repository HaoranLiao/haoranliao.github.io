<!--I'm a research scientist at <a href="https://q-ctrl.com/">Q-CTRL</a>, trying to understand what impacts quantum computers can make in the real world, and how they can help physicists.-->

A curious soul who tries to be a physicist. <!--Currently, I'm particularly interested in superconducting device physics and quantum error correction.-->

I'm exploring quantum error correction, quantum simulation, optimization, and algorithms. I have a solid background in quantum error mitigation/suppression/correction, superconducting qubit control, quantum error characterization, open-system dynamics, quantum machine learning, etc. I graduated with my Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, supervised by K. Birgitta Whaley. I was also an intern at IBM Quantum, supervised by Zlatko K. Minev. I'm currently a senior research scientist at <a href="https://q-ctrl.com/">Q-CTRL</a>. Welcome to check out my work through the slides accessible from the navigation bar.

Besides physics, I'm also interested in computer science and its interplay with physics.
In my free time I like traveling, and photography---here's my <a href="https://lhr.myportfolio.com/">portfolio</a>.
