Long-range entangling gates are highly desirable for solid-state devices. Improving the ability to achieve high-fidelity long-range CNOT gates is highly desirable in solid-state devices, where physical circuit architectures constrain effective device connectivity. These gates are particularly important for the large-scale implementation of algorithms like the quantum Fourier transform and fermionic simulations, and facilitate the use of non-local QEC codes such as quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. Previous work by BÃ¤umer et al. demonstrated teleportation of a CNOT gate using a measurement-based protocol across up to 100 lattice sites, achieving the highest fidelities for such tasks on superconducting processors at the time. Published in <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prxquantum/abstract/10.1103/PRXQuantum.6.020331">PRX Quantum</a>, we present a novel protocol
for long-range CNOT gates that achieves superior performance across up to at least 40 lattice sites by relying primarily on unitary operations and incorporating low-overhead error detection.

Our paper also presented the preparation of GHZ states up to 75 qubits, achieved with sparse parity checks for error detection and assited by error suppression. This record has been documented in the <a href="https://mariokrenn.wordpress.com/2021/01/29/reference-list-for-records-in-large-entanglement-generation-number-of-qubits-in-ghz-states/">Largest genuine entanglement: Qubits in GHZ state</a> tracking website. Our work is also covered by <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2480310-are-entangled-qubits-following-a-quantum-moores-law/">New Scientist</a> (<a href="https://archive.ph/UTnKL">archived webpage</a>).

I would like to ammend <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bl0N_nS3pTwjV9Y8LEgUwpq40AHjOf6ZPSPXCS_8njc/edit?usp=sharing">a small correction to our Appendix D</a>, clarifying why the fidelity estimation of an n-qubit GHZ state by sampling its stabilizers drastically underestimates the state fidelity and is unfavored.
