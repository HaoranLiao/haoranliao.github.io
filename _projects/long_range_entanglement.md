Long-range entangling gates are highly desirable for solid-state devices. Improving the ability to achieve high-fidelity long-range CNOT gates is highly desirable in solid-state devices, where physical circuit architectures constrain effective device connectivity. These gates are particularly important for the large-scale implementation of algorithms like the quantum Fourier transform and fermionic simulations, and facilitate the use of non-local QEC codes such as quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. Previous work by BÃ¤umer et al. demonstrated teleportation of a CNOT gate using a measurement-based protocol across up to 100 lattice sites, achieving the highest fidelities for such tasks on superconducting processors at the time. We present a novel protocol
for long-range CNOT gates that achieves superior performance across up to at least 40 lattice sites by relying primarily on unitary operations and incorporating error detection.
