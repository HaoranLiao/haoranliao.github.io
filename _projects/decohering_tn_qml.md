We were invited to talk about our paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s42484-022-00095-9?sharing_token=juY2ONwZu6BxL3Pr4yNZdfe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY46VNXljuQS_H5IuIBH2IzJo-KLgq6brIAUe1T9vl4D8Ob9uJDCsXwFT0VN6vgYuJl-YhIn2xo5cdFaKQlJqC3M0UJ_d7U1oj2VUiV6ly7wS0Dgb95hBhq6GX0M_SjFHe4=">*Decohering Tensor Network Quantum Machine Learning Model*</a> at the <a href="https://granadaseminar.com/">17th Granada Seminar</a>. Learn about our study connecting general quantum machine learning models to classical Bayesian networks in our slides below.
