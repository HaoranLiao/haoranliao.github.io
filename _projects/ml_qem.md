This paper investigates the practical utility of machine learning for quantum error mitigation (ML-QEM) which primarily has the advantage of being arguably the most efficient QEM method at runtime---we ask the following questions: <br>
a) How well does it perform under realistic noise? <br>
b) How efficient it can be even if considering training overhead? <br>
c) In what applications can it be particularly useful? <br>
d) Whether it be scaled to classically intractable circuits? <br>
Our work suggests positive results in all these aspects. <br>

I had the opportunity to discuss this at the live-streamed weekly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/w7GHPmfCzZs?si=MMaW3E6smH1is4rN">Qiskit Seminar</a> on Qiskit's YouTube channel, and at the <a href="https://qai-workshop.ornl.gov/schedule/">IEEE Quantum Week 2023</a>. We are also interviewed by <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-12-simple-machine-techniques-quantum-error.html">phys.org</a> and welcome to check out the coverage.
