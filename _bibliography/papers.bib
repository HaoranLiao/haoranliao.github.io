  title={Achieving Computational Gains with QEC Primitives: Generation of Long-range Entanglement Enhanced by Error Detection},
  author={Liao, Haoran and Hartnett, Gavin S. and Kakkar, Ashish and Mundada, Pranav P. and Biercuk, Michael J. and Baum, Yuval},
  abstract={The resource overhead required to achieve net computational benefits from quantum error correction (QEC) limits its utility while current systems remain constrained in size, despite exceptional progress in experimental demonstrations. In this paper, we demonstrate that the strategic application of QEC primitives without logical encoding can yield significant advantages on superconducting processors---relative to any alternative error-reduction strategy---while only requiring modest overhead. We first present a novel protocol for implementing long-range CNOT gates that relies on a unitarily-prepared Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as well as a unitary disentangling step; the protocol natively introduces an error-detection process using the disentangled qubits as flags. We demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art gate fidelities of over 85% across up to 40 lattice sites, significantly and consistently outperforming the best alternative measurement-based protocol without introducing any additional ancilla qubits. We then apply sparse stabilizer measurements to generate large GHZ states by detecting bit-flip and amplitude-damping errors. Employing this technique in combination with deterministic error suppression, we generate a 75-qubit GHZ state exhibiting genuine multipartite entanglement, the largest reported to date. The generation requires no more than 9 ancilla qubits and the fraction of samples discarded due to errors grows no higher than 78\%, far lower than previous discard fractions required for tests using comparable numbers of fully encoded qubits. This work in total represents compelling evidence that adopting QEC primitives on current-generation devices can deliver substantial net benefits.},

  abstract={Learning unknown processes affecting a quantum system reveals underlying physical mechanisms and enables suppression, mitigation, and correction of unwanted effects. Describing a general quantum process requires an exponentially large number of parameters. Measuring these parameters, when they are encoded in incompatible observables, is constrained by the uncertainty principle and requires exponentially many measurements. However, for Pauli channels, having access to an ideal quantum memory and entangling operations allows encoding parameters in commuting observables, thereby exponentially reducing measurement complexity. In practice, though, quantum memory and entangling operations are always noisy and introduce errors, making the advantage of using noisy quantum memory unclear. To address these challenges we introduce error-mitigated entanglement-enhanced learning and show, both theoretically and experimentally, that even with noise, there is a separation in efficiency between learning Pauli channels with and without entanglement with noisy quantum memory. We demonstrate our protocol's efficacy in examples including hypothesis testing with up to 64 qubits and learning inherent noise processes in a layer of parallel gates using up to 16 qubits on a superconducting quantum processor. Our protocol provides accurate and practical information about the process, with an overhead factor of 1.33Â±0.05 per qubit, much smaller than the fundamental lower bound of 2 without entanglement with quantum memory. Our study demonstrates that entanglement with auxiliary noisy quantum memory combined with error mitigation considerably enhances the learning of quantum processes.},

  title={Suppressing Correlated Noise in Quantum Computers via Context-aware Compiling},
  author={Seif, Alireza and Liao, Haoran and Tripathi, Vinay and Krsulich, Kevin and Malekakhlagh, Moein and Amico, Mirko and Jurcevic, Petar and Javadi-Abhari, Ali},
  abstract={Coherent errors, and especially those that occur in correlation among a set of qubits, are detrimental for large-scale quantum computing. Correlations in noise can occur as a result of spatial and temporal configurations of instructions executing on the quantum processor. In this paper, we perform a detailed experimental characterization of many of these error sources, and theoretically connect them to the physics of superconducting qubits and gate operations. Equipped with this knowledge, we devise compiler strategies to suppress these errors using dynamical decoupling or error compensation into the rest of the circuit. Importantly, these strategies are successful when the context at each layer of computation is taken into account: how qubits are connected, what crosstalk terms exist on the device, and what gates or idle periods occur in that layer. Our context-aware compiler thus suppresses some dominant sources of error, making further error mitigation or error correction substantially less expensive. For example, our experiments show an increase of 18.5\% in layer fidelity for a candidate 10-qubit circuit layer compared to context-unaware suppression. Owing to the exponential nature of error mitigation, these improvements due to error suppression translate to several orders of magnitude reduction of sampling overhead for a circuit consisting of a moderate number of layers.},

  title={ML-powered FPGA-based Real-time Quantum State Discrimination Enabling Mid-circuit Measurements},
  author={Vora, Neel R. and Xu, Yilun and Hashim, Akel and Fruitwala, Neelay and Nguyen, Ho Nam and Liao, Haoran and Whaley, K. Birgitta and Siddiqi, Irfan and al., et},
  abstract={Similar to reading the transistor state in classical computers, identifying the quantum bit (qubit) state is a fundamental operation to translate quantum information. However, identifying quantum state has been the slowest and most susceptible to errors operation on superconducting quantum processors. Most existing state discrimination algorithms have only been implemented and optimized "after the fact" - using offline data transferred from control circuits to host computers. Real-time state discrimination is not possible because a superconducting quantum state only survives for a few hundred us, which is much shorter than the communication delay between the readout circuit and the host computer (i.e., tens of ms). Mid-circuit measurement (MCM), where measurements are conducted on qubits at intermediate stages within a quantum circuit rather than solely at the end, represents an advanced technique for qubit reuse. For MCM necessitating single-shot readout, it is imperative to employ an in-situ technique for state discrimination with low latency and high accuracy. This paper introduces QubiCML, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) based system for real-time state discrimination enabling MCM - the ability to measure the state at the control circuit before/without transferring data to a host computer. A multi-layer neural network has been designed and deployed on an FPGA to ensure accurate in-situ state discrimination. For the first time, ML-powered quantum state discrimination has been implemented on a radio frequency system-on-chip FPGA platform. The deployed lightweight network on the FPGA only takes 54 ns to complete each inference. We evaluated QubiCML's performance on superconducting quantum processors and obtained an average accuracy of 98.5% with only 500 ns readout. QubiCML has the potential to be the standard real-time state discrimination method for the quantum community.},

  abstract={Quantum computers progress toward outperforming classical supercomputers, but quantum errors remain their primary obstacle. The key to overcoming errors on near-term devices has emerged through the field of quantum error mitigation, enabling improved accuracy at the cost of additional run time. 
Here, through experiments on state-of-the-art quantum computers using up to 100 qubits, we demonstrate that without sacrificing accuracy machine learning for quantum error mitigation (ML-QEM) drastically reduces the cost of mitigation. We benchmark ML-QEM using a variety of machine learning models---linear regression, random forests, multi-layer perceptrons, and graph neural networks---on diverse classes of quantum circuits, over increasingly complex device-noise profiles,  under interpolation and extrapolation, and in both numerics and experiments. These tests employ the popular digital zero-noise extrapolation method as an added reference. Finally, we propose a path toward scalable mitigation by using ML-QEM to mimic traditional mitigation methods with superior runtime efficiency. Our results show that classical machine learning can extend the reach and practicality of quantum error mitigation by reducing its overheads and highlight its broader potential for practical quantum computations.},

  abstract={Tensor network quantum machine learning (QML) models are promising applications on near-term quantum hardware. While decoherence of qubits is expected to decrease the performance of QML models, it is unclear to what extent the diminished performance can be compensated for by adding ancillas to the models and accordingly increasing the virtual bond dimension of the models. We investigate here the competition between decoherence and adding ancillas on the classification performance of two models, with an analysis of the decoherence effect from the perspective of regression. We present numerical evidence that the fully-decohered unitary tree tensor network (TTN) with two ancillas performs at least as well as the non-decohered unitary TTN, suggesting that it is beneficial to add at least two ancillas to the unitary TTN regardless of the amount of decoherence may be consequently introduced.},

  title={Machine Learning for Continuous Quantum Error Correction on Superconducting Qubits},
  author={Liao, Haoran and Convy, Ian and Zhang, Song and Patel, Sahil and P. Livingston, William and Siddiqi, Irfan and Whaley, K. Birgitta},
  abstract={Continuous quantum error correction has been found to have certain advantages over discrete quantum error correction, such as a reduction in hardware resources and the elimination of error mechanisms introduced by having entangling gates and ancilla qubits. We propose a machine learning algorithm for continuous quantum error correction that is based on the use of a recurrent neural network to identity bit-flip errors from continuous noisy syndrome measurements. The algorithm is designed to operate on measurement signals deviating from the ideal behavior in which the mean value corresponds to a code syndrome value and the measurement has white noise. We analyze continuous measurements taken from a superconducting architecture using three transmon qubits to identify three significant practical examples of non-ideal behavior, namely auto-correlation at temporal short lags, transient syndrome dynamics after each bit-flip, and drift in the steady-state syndrome values over the course of many experiments. Based on these real-world imperfections, we generate synthetic measurement signals from which to train the recurrent neural network, and then test its proficiency when implementing active error correction, comparing this with a traditional double threshold scheme and a discrete Bayesian classifier. The results show that our machine learning protocol is able to outperform the double threshold protocol across all tests, achieving a final state fidelity comparable to the discrete Bayesian classifier.},

  abstract={State-of-the-art classical neural networks are observed to be vulnerable to small crafted adversarial perturbations. A more severe vulnerability has been noted for quantum machine learning (QML) models classifying Haar-random pure states. This stems from the concentration of measure phenomenon, a property of the metric space when sampled probabilistically, and is independent of the classification protocol. To provide insights into the adversarial robustness of a quantum classifier on real-world classification tasks, we focus on the adversarial robustness in classifying a subset of encoded states that are smoothly generated from a Gaussian latent space. We show that the vulnerability of this task is considerably weaker than that of classifying Haar-random pure states. In particular, we find only mildly polynomially decreasing robustness in the number of qubits, in contrast to the exponentially decreasing robustness when classifying Haar-random pure states and suggesting that QML models can be useful for real-world classification tasks.},

  author={Convy, Ian and Huggins, William J. and Liao, Haoran and Whaley, K. Birgitta},
  abstract={Tensor networks have emerged as promising tools for machine learning, inspired by their widespread use as variational ansatzes in quantum many-body physics. It is well known that the success of a given tensor network ansatz depends in part on how well it can reproduce the underlying entanglement structure of the target state, with different network designs favoring different scaling patterns. We demonstrate here how a related correlation analysis can be applied to tensor network machine learning, and explore whether classical data possess correlation scaling patterns similar to those found in quantum states. We utilize mutual information as a natural analog to entanglement for classical data, and show that it can serve as a lower-bound on the network entanglement needed for probabilistic classification. We then develop a logistic regression algorithm to estimate the mutual information between bipartitions of data features, and verify its accuracy on a set of Gaussian distributions designed to mimic different correlation patterns. Using this algorithm, we characterize the scaling patterns in the MNIST and Tiny Images datasets, and find clear evidence of boundary-law scaling in the latter.},
